Notes for Thomas Forsythe, Sr.:
From the book "The Pioneer Forsythes of Fayette County, Pennsylvania and Their 
Descendants" (Forsythe Book) by Glenn Luther Forsythe, "According to a letter 
written 
by Mary Ann Forsythe, a granddaughter of Thomas and Nancy (Parker) Forsythe, to 
Mary Ann's daughter, L. W. Reynolds, 'Thomas Forsythe came to America from Ireland 
and settled in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.  He met a Dutch lady, Miss Nancy Parker, 
(and) they were married and had a family of ten children.'
"There is some doubt as to whether Nancy Parker was Dutch.  Parker is not a Dutch 
name and there were no substantial Dutch settlements in the vicinity at the time.  
One of the daughters did marry a Mr. Vandine (VanDyne?), though, so it is possible 
that Nancy did have some Dutch ancestry.
"The earliest record located so far shows that Thomas Forsithe acquired a warrant to 
purchase a tract of land in Tyrone Township (now Perry Township), Fayette County, 
Pennsylvania on January 21, 1785.  In December of the same year he obtained a patent 
for that land and purchased it.  In the first records concerning him the Forsythe 
name was spelled Forsithe.  It is spelled Forsythe in the 1790 Federal population 
census and in current usage."
Further from the Forsythe Book, "Little information about the origin of Thomas 
Forsythe other than what has been passed on by family traditions and the federal 
censuses exists.  Mrs. George Marsh of West Newton, Pennsylvania, stated that Thomas 
tomahawked a tract of land, probably the same tract which he later acquired by 
warrant when Fayette County was first opened to settlers.  But he had to leave 
because of Indian hostilities.  In 1774 (?) he returned when Governor Dunsmore of 
Virginia reopened the area.  Thomas probably married at that time as his first child 
(Elizabeth?) was born about 1779."
The Indian problems occurred in the mid-1760's after the white encroachment reached 
an intolerable level, and several incidents of whites killing Indians raised the 
Indian rage to a fever pitch.  At that point Governor Dunsmore of Virginia, who was 
the primary official who turned his back as the whites encroached, finally called 
for all whites to vacate the area.  By 1768 a treaty had been executed with the 
Indians and their lands comprising current day south-western Pennsylvania was 
purchased for white settlement.  The territory was officially opened in 1769 for 
settlement.  If Thomas was present at the time of the Indian hostilities, then he 
was likely born 10 to 15 years earlier than his estimated birth date stated above.  
That part of Pennsylvania was part of Bedford County, Pennsylvania in 1772.  
According to the 1772 Bedford County tax list as published in "The Monongahela of 
Old or Historical Sketches of South-western Pennsylvania to the Year 1800" by James 
Veech, 1910, no Thomas Forsythe was listed - either among the heads of household, 
borders with no household, or freemen.  It is possible he came to the area sometime 
after 1772 or it is possible he was there and not counted or counted among Virginia 
tax rolls.  This same area of southwestern Pennsylvania was also claimed by Virginia 
and was Yohogania County within the District of West Augusta.  (Virginia sold land 
for as low as 10 shillings per 100 acres and Pennsylvania sold for about 5 pounds 
sterling, according to Veech.  There was much contention between the two factions 
with anyone holding office under the laws of Pennsylvania and attempting any official 
act was likely to be arrested and jailed by persons claiming to hold office under the 
government of Virginia, and vice versa for the Virginia officials.  The issue was 
not settled, in Pennsylvania's favor, until the Mason-Dixon Line was officially run 
in 1785 - the year Thomas purchased his land.)  The 1772 Bedford County tax list did 
contain the name of Frederick Parker listed in Springhill Township.  Could this have 
been Nancy's father?  Also listed in Springhill Township was Christian Pitser, father 
of Rebecca and wife-to-be of John, son of Thomas Sr.
In February 26, 1773 Westmoreland County was spun off from Bedford County.  This 
county was all of southwestern Pennsylvania, which included the area that is now 
Fayette County.  Glen Swartz in the RootsWeb World Connect database "glen_swartz" 
quotes research done by W. Don Shoaf from Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Deed 
Book A-1, page 160, "1778 Jun 01, Deed.  Charles Martin to Thomas Forsythe, 150 acres
 (with all improvements) on the south side of Youghiogheny River, adjoining John 
Vanmeter, a run, the top of Rich Hill, Mr Powers, and Moses Thompson; it being the 
upper part of a 300 acre tract, the lower 150 acres of which was sold to Thomas Reed.  
Price: 100 PA currency.  Witnesses: Moses Thompson and Edward Cook."  This timeframe 
fits the estimated time of the start of his family, and this area fits the general 
area of the subsequent warrant and purchase mentioned in the Forsythe book above and 
in the material that follows.  That warrant was in Fayette County, and Fayette County 
was formed from Westmoreland County on September 26, 1783.
As found in "History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania: with Biographical Sketches of 
Many of Its Pioneers and Prominent Men"; edited by Franklin Ellis; L. H. Everts & 
Co., Philadelphia, 1882, page 715 in the Perry township history section, "Gen. J. B. 
Sweitzer owns 240 acres of land adjoining the Beeler tract, east on Jacob's Creek.  
This was part of the Turnbull lands.  Thomas Forsyth took out a patent for 171 acres 
of land in this part of the township.  He had sons, - Ezekiel, David, and Thomas.  
Ezekiel settled on the homestead.  His son Thomas now lives on the farm adjoining.  
Henry and John, sons of Ezekiel, both live near.  David, son of Thomas, lived in 
Westmoreland County."  This warrant description is supported by the following 
information.
Fayette County attained its final, and current, boundaries in 1784 and the county 
government set about mapping out the land claims of its inhabitants.  According to 
the Fayette County Warrant Register, page 84, Thomas Forsithe obtained Fayette Co, 
survey warrant No.4 for Patentee surnames starting with F for these 150 acres he 
purchased in 1778.  The date of the survey warrant was January 21, 1785 with the 
return date being December 17, 1785 and the acres in the return determined as 171 
acres rather than 150.  The register identifies the patent to be registered in Vol. 
P, No. 4, Page 268 and the survey to be found copied in Book A61, Page 197 in Tyrone 
Township.  The survey states "Situated in Poverty Neck on the East Side of 
Youghiogeni River in Tyrone Township Fayette County and surveyed the 21st Day of May 
1785.  In Pursuance of a Warrant Dated the 21 Day of January 1785 by Alexander M 
Clean Deputy."  The accompanying map identifies Thomas' property as adjoining those 
of Joseph Whitesides, Peter Studibaker and an area to the south and west identified 
as Vacant Inaccesable River Hills.

In Thomas Forsythe's will, dated November 9, 1807, he does as we all wish with wills 
of our ancestors and names all of his children.  He provides for wife, Nancy, with 
the house and two cows and the provision that she be "supported with bread and meat" 
while she remained a widow.  He then provides for sons John, Thomas, David and 
Ezekiel and for daughters Elizabeth Vandine, Peggy (Margaret) Jones, Nancy Jones, 
Hannah McKenna, and Polly and Sally (both of whom he mentions have not yet come of 
age).  The lands, goods and chattels were to be split equally by David and Ezekiel 
and to be paid at Nancy's death.  The will went to probate on January 16, 1808 with 
son-in-law Richard Jones "My hole and Sole Executer of this My Last Will and 
Testement" and son David "Forsithe Executer of this My Last Will and Testement".  I 
am not clear as to Whole and Sole Executor versus Executor.
