Nathaniel was born to John Thomas and Nancy Rebeca Forsythe Morrison in Marion Township, near
Ash Grove, Davis County, Iowa. He married Halsie Smith on Christmas Eve 1906 in her parent's
residence in Davis County.

They left early in their married life, along with his brother William Morrison and family, for
Huron, Beadle County, South Dakota. William began work as a baggageman for the Chicago
Northwestern Railroad, while Nathaniel's occupation was manual laborer. Nathaniel's son,
Melvin, shows as born about 1917 in Oklahoma, but Nathaniel and family are shown in Bremerton
where he spends the remainder of his life. Both the 1920 and 1930 censuses show him as a
laborer with City of Bremerton Water Department.
