Ivah Icel Morrison

Ivah Icel Morrison, the little daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Morrison was born December 2, 1903,
died May 25, 1905, age 1 year, 5 months and 23 days. The funeral was preached Friday 26, at 10
o'clock at the house by Rev. Ed Hastings, and the little one was laid to rest in the Mounts
cemetry, whooping cough and pneumonia being the cause of death.

How mornful seems in broken dreams the memory of the day, when icy death hath sealed the breath
of dear Icel's form of clay. When pale unmoved the face we loved, the face we thought so fair
and the hand lies cold, whose fervent hold once charmed away despair. Ah, what could heal the
grief we feel for hopes that come no more had we never heard the scripture word not lost but gone
before.
