Eliza J. Forsythe

Eliza J. Forsythe was born September 11, 1838, near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. She was married
to Christian Glassbourner in the year 1857. To this union ten children were born. Her husband
preceded her to their better home.

Her three surviving children, Mrs. Rachel Goodwin, Fairfield, Iowa, Mrs. Eva Strunk and David
Glassbourner, of Bunch were at her bedside constantly during her last days. Mother Glassbourner
departed this life at the home of her son, David, west of Bunch, October 24th, 1914, after an
illness of nine weeks' duration, aged 76 years, 1 month and 13 days. Besides her three surviving
children she leaves two sisters, Mrs. George Adams of Drakesville and Mrs. Nancy Morrison of Bunch.

She was a member of the Pleasant Hill Christian church for many years preceding her death.

All that could be done for her during her few declining weeks, was done by her children and friends.

Funeral services were held at the Pleasant Hill church Sunday, October 25th, by Rev. H. E. Bunker
of Exline, Iowa. Interment was made by the side of her husband in the Glassbourner cemetery. A
large concourse of friends were present to pay their last respects to one who had so long lived
among them, realizing that our loss is heaven's gain.

The children wish to express their thanks to their friends and neighbors for their many deeds of
kindness and help in their sorrow.
