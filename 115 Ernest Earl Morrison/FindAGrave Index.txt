Ernest Earl, oldest son of Tenny and Rosa Morrison, was born in Davis County, Iowa,
Oct. 6, 1905, and departed this life Aug. 10, 1933, at the age of 27 years, 10 months
and 4 days.
He leaves to mourn his departure his two little daughters, Marietta, age 5 years, and
Marlyn, age 3 years, his mother, Mrs. Rosa Morrison, one sister Delma, three brothers,
Ralph, Emery and Homer, all of Bunch, Iowa. His father and one sister Zelma preceded him
in death. He also leaves his grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Coop and a host of other
relatives and friends. He was a kind father, son and brother. He will be sadly missed in
the home and community.
Funeral services were held at Pleasant Hill church Aug. 11, 1933, at 2 o'clock by Rev.
Floyd Edwards of Moulton. Three songs, "Going Down the Valley", "No Disappointment in
Heaven", "Does Jesus Care", were sung by Mrs. Charles Johnson and Miss Cleo Smith. Six
uncles were pallbearers: Lester and Earl Coop, Perry and Luther Morrison, Everett Brooke
and Frank Rose. The body was laid to rest in the Mounts cemetery.

A precious one from us is gone.
A voice we loved is still.
A place is vacant in our home
Which never can be filled.

[What became of his wife Margaret?(1930 census of Fox River, Davis, Iowa p.46)]
GaryM writes: Margaret Vera Whisler Morrison married Ora Dowe Scott from Unionville,
Davis County, Iowa. They married 9 Aug 1938 in Lancaster, Missouri. He died 31 May 1970
in Unionville, Appanoose County and she died 21 Mar 1997. Her Soc. Sec. Death Index entry
shows her last residence as Unionville, Appanoose County, but a researcher has her death
location as Iowa City, Johnson County. It could be she was taken to the U. of Iowa hospitals
and died there. She is buried in Taylor Cemetery in Davis County. A couple of researchers show
she had at least one child by Ora before they married.
