"...Michael Sowers lived in an old cabin and ferried people across the river.
After his death one Dunn lived in the cabin.  He was drowned a few years later, 
and the place was long known as 'Dunn's Deep Hole.'  There is an old burial-place in 
the rear of where the cabin stood, where seventy or seventy-five years ago hundreds of 
graves were to be seen.  In 1812, Aaron Jones lived there, and his wife was drowned in 
the river while crossing in a canoe.  The name was changed from Dunn's to Layton's after 
the purchase by Abraham Layton in 1821."
