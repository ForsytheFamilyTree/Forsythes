Although the tombstone says his birth was 1875, his obituary below states 1874, which is
consistent with the age stated on his wedding certificate.

John Morrison

John Morrison, second son of Thomas and Nancy Morrison was born November 7, 1874, in Davis
county and departed this life August 24, 1938, at the age of 63 years, 9 months and 17 days.

On December 10, 1902, he was united in marriage to Florence Elder and to this union were born
six children.

He was a kind and loving husband and father and a good neighbor, always ready to lend a helping
hand in time of need.

In 1930 his health began to fail and since that time he had been a constant sufferer with asthma
and heart trouble. But it was just a week before his death that he became critically ill. During
that time he suffered intensely and all that loving hand could do gradually failed. He was a
cheerful patient and always had a smile for everyone.

He is survived by his faithful companion and the following children: Fallace, Karl, and Lorene
at home; Mrs. Marq Rae of Oskaloosa and Floyd of Taintor. One daughter, Icel, preceded him in
death. He also leaves four grandchildren, whom he dearly loved, one sister and six brothers,
besides a host of other relatives and friends. His passing has brought great sadness in the home.

His funeral was held at the Powers funeral home at Oskaloosa and he was laid to rest in the
Mounts cemetery west of Ash Grove.
