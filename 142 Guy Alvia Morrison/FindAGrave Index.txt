GUY MORRISON
Guy Morrison, youngest son of John Thomas and Nancy Morrison was born April 16, 1892, and died,
April 15, 1950 at the age of 57 years. He passed away the day before his 58th birthday.

Born in Davis county near Bunch, he attended the local school and church and as a young man
worked on farms moving from Davis county to the communities of Lynville and Grinnell, Iowa,
more than 35 years ago. At the time of his failing health he was employed at the Maytag Factory
in Newton.

On June 6, 191 (sic), he was united in marriage with Hazel Parker and they had made their home
on a farm six miles south of Grinnell.

He is survived by his wife, and sister, Mrs. George Collins of Unionville, Iowa, and five
brothers, Will of Huron, S. Dak., Than of Bremerton, Wash., Lacey of Centerville, Iowa, and
Perry and Luther of Bunch, Iowa.

He was preceded in death by his parents, three brothers, Tenny of Bunch, John of Oskaloosa
and one infant brother, and two sons by a former marriage, Earl, who died in 1930 and Emery
who died in the service of his country in the last war.

He was loved by all who knew him, kind and gentle in his ways and through all his suffering
never complained but had a smile for everyone who came to see him. He will be greatly missed
by a host of relatives, friends and neighbors.

Funeral services were held at the James Funeral Home in Grinnell, Iowa, Tuesday, April 18,
in charge of Rev. Athena Mortimer. Vocal music was provided by Mrs. Iona Hayl and Mrs. Mable
McDowell, accompanied by Mrs. Irma Laymiller.

Pallbearers were Harvey Marcum, Howard Jones, Amos Smith, Floyd Beason, Orville Peterson and
Perry Wilson. Interment was in Hazelwood cemetery in Grinnell, Iowa.
