Notes for Nancy Parker:
Not a great deal is known about Nancy, other than what was mentioned in the notes for Thomas.  The name has evidently been passed from generation to generation as there has been no documentation found other than the letter mentioned above.  It is possible she was born in Pennsylvania, but that also is unknown.  If Fredrick Parker from above is indeed her father, then we know she was in the area by 1772.  She might not have been in the immediate vicinity too much before that because settlement in this area was not "officially" allowed until 1769, after a peace settlement had been reached with the Indians, although many settlers took it upon themselves to encroach on Indian land long before 1769.  Her birth date is estimated from the 1800 census which has her at age 45 or greater.
Nancy is shown as head of household, age greater than 45, in 1810 Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, page 235.  Also in the household were 1 male age 16 to 26, 1 female age 10 to 16, and 1 female age 16 to 26.  Nancy is shown on line 27.  Nearby are other members of the family - line 26 David Forsythe, line 23 Thomas Forsythe, line 22 Richard Jones, and line 21 Aaron Jones.  Aaron is not proven to be a son-in-law, but there is that possibility and will be mentioned below.  Nancy is not found by name in the 1820 census, but there is a possibility she is the female of age 45 and up living in the Ezekiel Forsyth family in Tyrone Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, page 144 (and on the line immmediately below David Forsythe).  Now Thomas Jr. was in Tyrone Township in 1817, 1818 and 1819 tax lists, then was found in the 1820 Brown County, Ohio census (see Thomas Jr. narrative in previous generation).  It is very possible he was in Tyrone because his mother's health was declining during that time and that he left for Brown County, Ohio after her death to be with brother John and his family.  Since the 1820 census day was officially August 7, 1820, with the following 13 months alloted for collecting the enumeration data, it is likely Nancy died between that date and September 7, 1821 and Thomas Jr. and family still had time to get to Brown County, Ohio for that enumeration.  Even if Nancy had died before the census taker got to Ezekiel's home, the enumerator was instructed to include her if she had been alive on August 7, 1820.  In the 1821 tax list Ezekiel and David had divided the land of Thomas Forsythe, each taxed on 80 acres.  Presumably this supports the above possibility and means then that Nancy had died, for Thomas wrote in his will the lands, goods and chattels were to be split equally by David and Ezekiel and to be paid at Nancy's death.
Thomas and Nancy are believed to be buried at Jacobs Creek Cemetery in Westmoreland County, just across the Fayette County line.  This is located about a mile and a half from the original family homestead.  It is located on the flood plain of the Youghiogheny River and many stones have been destroyed.  Whatever the reason, their stones have not survived.
