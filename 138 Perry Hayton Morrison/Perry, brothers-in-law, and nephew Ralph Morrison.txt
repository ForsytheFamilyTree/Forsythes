Perry Hayton Morrison is the fifth-born child of John Thomas and Nancy Rebeca shown here second
from left. Left to right, these men are Earl Coop, Perry, Lester Coop, Frank Rose, Everette
Brooke and Ralph Morrison. Earl and Lester are brothers to Avis, Anna, Rosa and Effie Coop.
Frank married Avis and Everette married Anna.  Ralph is son of Tenny and Rosa, so all the other
men are his uncles. This picture, taken circa 1950, was given me by Pat Howk, granddaughter of
Earl.
