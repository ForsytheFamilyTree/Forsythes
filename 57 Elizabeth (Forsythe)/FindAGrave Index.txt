Nothing is known of Elizabeth's family, but the census entries identify her as having been born in New Jersey. There was a sizable settlement of New Jersey "immigrants" in the Elizabeht Township area of Allegheny County. Since she and Thomas were married in this county, it is very possible she was part of this settlement.
