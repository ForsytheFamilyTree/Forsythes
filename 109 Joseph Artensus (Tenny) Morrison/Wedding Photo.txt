This picture was supplied to me by Pat Howk, a relative of Tenny's second wife Rosa Coop. 
Joseph Artensus (Tenny) Morrison, oldest child of John Thomas and Nancy Rebeca is on the right,
and Rosa May Coop is on the left.  This is their wedding picture - November 1903.  Tenny was
first married to Rosa May Livingston (see previous picture).  They divorced in December 1900
but remarried in May 1901 only to be divorced again in a couple of months.  Thus this is
Tenny's third marriage, but second wife.
