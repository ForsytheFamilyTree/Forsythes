Ann Forsythe, who died 27 Mark 1886)

April 1, 1866
To: Thomas Forsythe
Dear Friends:
I now sit down to rite those few lines to let you no (know) that we are all in a reason(able)
state of health at this time, and we hope those few lines may find you all in the enjoyment
of the same blessing. I received your leter March the third. We was all glad to hear from you
and the friends and neibours. I would have answered your letter sooner but time and opportunity
wood not permit me to do so. Polly Ann was at that time feeling very low. She has now gon to pay
the debt that we all must pay sooner or later. She died on last Tuesday night half past 11 o'clock.
She died verry happy. She told us this was not her home. She said Heaven was her home and she
wanted to git there. She died enjoying herself very much. This was a grait satisfaction to us all.
Her disease was consumption. she suffered very much and took a grait deal of medicine but nothing
done any good. She had to go.

Dear cozens you must excuse the shortness of this letter for the present riting is a hard task for
me at this time. (Please rite soon).

Dear Cozen Martha Forsyth. We send you a small Morsel of Dear Pollys Hair to look at in remembrance
of her.

(s) John and Mary Ann Forsyth"
