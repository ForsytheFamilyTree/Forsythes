John Forsythe and sister Mary Ann Forsythe are the only two children of Thomas and Elizabeth
Forsythe. Brother and sister, John and Mary Ann, and parents, Thomas and Elizabeth, all moved
to Iowa in the early 1850s - but at slightly different times. To the north, in Wapello County,
Iowa there would be a Forsyth (no e) family. There is no known relationship except some
inter-marriage. One daughter, Eliza, married Joseph Morrison. They had one child, John Thomas
who married John's daughter Nancy Rebeca. Also, a brother of Eliza, William, married John's
sister Mary Ann. All of these individuals lived in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania area.
It is not clear what reason was for the chain of migration to Iowa, but the Glassburner family,
who also lived in Westmoreland County, started by deciding to move to Marion Township, Davis
County in 1847. In 1851, the Forsyth family moved to Richland Township in Wapello County, Iowa -
with the exception of 3 children including William and Mary Ann Forsyth and Joseph and Eliza
Forsyth Morrison. In 1853 William and Joseph moved to Wapello County for William to be near his
ailing father. In 1854 their wives, Mary Ann and Eliza, joined them. In 1855 John and wife Mary
Ann and their family, along with his parents Thomas and Elizabeth, moved to Davis County and
William and Mary Ann moved nearby from Wapello County. Thomas and John and families stayed
together in this spot near Ash Grove for the remainder of their lives.
