J. T. Morrison

J. T. Morrison was born in Pennsylvania, October 21, 1852, and died at his home in Bunch,
Iowa, March 7th, 1914, aged 61 years, 4 months and 26 days.

He came to Iowa with his parents when three years of age and has resided here most of the
time since. He was married to Nancy R. Forsyth(e) April 2, 1871. To this union were born 10
children 9 of whom are living and were present at the funeral, Tenny, John, May Collins,
William, Perry, Thanie, Lacy, Luther and Guy.

He made confession of his faith in the Pleasant Hill Christian church and lived in that
faith until his death. Bro. Morrison was a good man in his family. He thought more of his
children and their interests than of his own. He was a loyal friend, constant in his support
and friendship.

He was an Elder of the Pleasant Hill church and served faithfully and efficiently as long as
he lived here. He believed in the church as the best of all societies and was always ready
to support the church both with time and money. He was a man wise in counsel, and his
judgment and advice was good and helpful.

He will be sadly missed in the community, but most of all in the home where no one can take
his place. He shall not return to us, but we shall go to him. He died as he desired, without
pain and quickly. We believe he was ready and also that he is with Christ which is far better.
Let us also be ready, for no man knoweth the day nor the hour. Let us live for the eternal,
not for things temporal. The funeral service was held at Pleasant Hill Christian church March
9th, conducted by E. A. Hastings of Floris and the I.O.O.F. lodge had charge of the body. An
unusual large crowd was present to show their respect and sorrow. Members of I.O.O.F. from
Bunch, Ash Grove, Drakesville and Bloomfield were present. Interment in Glassbourner cemetery.
