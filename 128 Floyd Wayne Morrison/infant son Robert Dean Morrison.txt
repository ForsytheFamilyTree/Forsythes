Morrison Babe
Died Wednesday
----------
The infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Morrison born Wednesday, September 15 lived but a few short
hours. Prayer services were conducted by the Rev. Samuel Jackson at the home Wednesday afternoon
and burial in the Friends Cemetery at New Sharon.

Like a little flower that blooms and fades,
Thus it was with darling baby.
Those brief moments we were so happy
Then all too soon our hearts were saddened,
For Bobby Dean had gone and left us.
So we must bear our sorrows patiently
Until we can meet him with the angels above.
-----------
