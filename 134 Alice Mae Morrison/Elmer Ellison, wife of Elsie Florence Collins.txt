First child of Alice Mae Morrison and George Collins is Elsie Florence Collins, wife of Elmer
Ellison. Elmer Ellison is shown here, second from left standing, with his parents and siblings. 
Elmer is a first cousin to Florence Belle Elder, wife of Alice's brother, John Clayton Morrison. 
The photo was given to me by Pat Howk, a relative of the Ellison family.
