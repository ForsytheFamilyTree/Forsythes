This picture was supplied to me by Mr. Jerald Smith, a descendant of Tenny and Rosa May
Livingston Morrison.  The picture is likely circa 1900.  From left are Della Morrison, Delpha
Morrison, Alva James Livingston (Rosa's brother), Rosa Livingston Morrison, Nettie Livingston
(Rosa's sister), Thomas Livingston (Rosa's father).  The man on the right was thought
originally to possibly be Joseph Artensus (aka Tenny), oldest child of John Thomas.
That is not the case, and the man is unknown.
