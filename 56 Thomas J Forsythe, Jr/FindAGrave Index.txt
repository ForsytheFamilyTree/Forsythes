The grave of Thomas, Jr. has a star identifying him as a veteran of the War of 1812. He is among the listing found in the Pennsylvania Archives Series 6, Volume VII, Chapter: Miscellaneous Rolls, Fifteenth Division 1812-1814, page 790 - Private Thos. Forsythe is among the returns of the "First Rifle Company Attached 125th Regt. Who Volunteered Their Service." The unit consisted of 42 privates guided by Captain James Scott, Lieutenant John Cochran, and Ensign Petter Beddsworth. A footnote to the listing stated "30 of the above Roll in uniform and Armed with Rifles & Tomahawks." Shortly after his father passed away, Thomas began to drift. This unit was formed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and this is where he met and married Elizabeth 29 March 1811. His militia unit never saw action and was activated for only 60 days.

By the 1817 he and Elizabeth reappear in Fayette County, Pennsylvania for a couple of years, then appear in Brown County, Ohio in 1820. This is where his brother John migrated before their father's death, which occurred in 1807. (This brother also migrated to Iowa, going to Appanoose County in 1854.) This migration is right after their mother's death in Fayette County and seems to mark the end of Thomas' link to Fayette County. By 1830 Thomas and Elizabeth are back in Allegheny County, then Westmoreland County by 1840 and 1850, moving to Davis County, Iowa in 1855.

Their son, John's, burial location is known to be Glassburner Cemetery. Their only other child, Mary Ann, also settled in Davis County, but her death and burial location are unknown.
