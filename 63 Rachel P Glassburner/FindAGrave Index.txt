in Davis County, Iowa. When they married, Rachel was already the mother of a daughter born out
of wedlock, Bertha A. Glassburner. She is identified in the 1880 census as the granddaughter of
Christian and Eliza Jane. Her marriage certificate identifies her as a Glassburner, and names
her mother at Rachel, with no father named. Bertha married Aaron B. Nott, son of Henry and Mary
Barber Nott, 2 September 1896 in Davis County, Iowa.

Rachel's 1910 census shows her as the mother of 6 with only 3 surviving. The other two were Dora
Icle Goodwin, wife of Clarence Havner, and Wilford Elzy Goodwin, husband of Grace Ellen Hamilton.
